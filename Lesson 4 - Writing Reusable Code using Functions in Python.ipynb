To achieve this, we might want to write a function that can take a number and round it up to the next integer (e.g., 1.2 is rounded up to 2). That would be a great exercise to try out!\n",

Namespaces provide encapsulation and avoid naming conflicts between your code and a module or across modules.\n",
